Hayya is the new all-in-one HQ system for use in VATMENA.

## What is this site?

This site contains documentation written by the Hayya team with information on how to use almost every part of Hayya, to ease the transition and help new users learn how to use the system.

## Need more help?

If the documentation is missing something, you have a question, or otherwise need help, you can either:

- contact a staff member in your facility, who can relay the request to the Hayya team
- post a message in the VATMENA Discord's #hayya-discussion channel
- if you have access to the VATMENA devtech discord, ask the team directly in #hayya-general (ping Tyler & Sam for urgent requests)

## Found a bug?

Please report bugs in the #hayya-bug-reports channel on the VATMENA discord to allow the team to properly file them into our internal ticket system.

## Have a great idea?

Request features in the #hayya-feature-requests channel on the VATMENA discord. Please note that feature requests are implemented at the discretion of the Hayya team, and may be ignored.
