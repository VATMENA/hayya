While it has other functions, the primary purpose of Hayya is to serve as the headquarters for the VATMENA Training Department. Hayya will be the one-stop-shop for all training-related items, whether than be administering OTS exams, taking your online training, written exams, requesting / scheduling training, or locating study materials.
At the moment, only some portions of the planned training system have been implemented. This section of the documentation will explain how to use each of them.
