With the release of the Training V2 system overhaul, Hayya is introducing a new system, the Training Plan system. Training plans intend to be a more consolidated and concise method of showing your facilities training tracks and to allow you to easily register for and begin requesting training along these tracks.

## Creating Training Plans

To create a training plan, you'll need the `training.plans.manage` permission.
